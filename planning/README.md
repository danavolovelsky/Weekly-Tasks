What is your website about? Is it directed to a particular field or industry?

- My Website is about showcasing my work and presenting it in form of a portfolio. It is directed to the creative as well as the computing industry. Also it is a way for myself to keep track of my progress and have all the works im most proud of in one organised setting.

Audience. Who are your visitors and what information will they be looking for?

- I guess my visitors would be people to which i send the portfolio to, so mainly in the job market, i want my audience to be recruiters and working professionals. They will be looking for my past work experience and other interesting projects i was part of. Maybe visitors would include people looking to get inspired by (or just generally interested in) my work.

What existing websites perform a similar function?

- Other portfolio websites pretty much perform the same thing. There are a couple that i really like, which you can view on my inspiration page (week 4). This page in particularly helped me plan my idea further: https://bokoko33.me
